Predicting Totalsleep and Dreaming time for mammals

# Installation (local)

• Install requirements :

pip install - r requirements-dreaming_prediction.txt   (to predict Dreaming).

pip install - r requirements-totalsleep-prediction.txt  (to predict Totalsleep).

pip install - r requirements-correlation-biological-ecological-attributes.txt  (to see the correlation between biological & ecological atributes).




# Project Resources:
Here are additional resources that may be helpful for the project. The dataset has been built 
from a merge of two studies on sleep duration in mammals:
• Allison T, Cicchetti DV. Sleep in mammals: ecological and constitutional correlates. 
Science. 1976 Nov 12;194(4266):732-4. doi: 10.1126/science.982039. PMID: 982039.
• Savage VM, West GB. A quantitative, theoretical framework for understanding 
mammalian sleep. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jan 16;104(3):1051-6. doi:
