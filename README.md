Predicting Totalsleep and Dreaming time for mammals

# Installation (local)

• Install requirements :

pip install - r requirements-dreaming_prediction.txt   (to predict Dreaming).

pip install - r requirements-totalsleep-prediction.txt  (to predict Totalsleep).

pip install - r requirements-correlation-biological-ecological-attributes.txt  (to see the correlation between biological & ecological atributes).


# Project purpose :

The objective of the project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict two features of mammals: 
their sleeping time and their dreaming time. To do so, we will use a data set composed of 16 attributes (columns), ranked in four categories: general, biological, ecological and sleep attributes. The data set is relatively small, which is common in the biology world.
The first part of the report will present our processes and thoughts to predict the total sleep. It will deal with the exploratory data analysis, the methods description and results interpretation. With the same structure, the second part will discuss about the prediction of the dreaming time. And finally, the third part will explore the links between the other attributes.

 # Data used :
 
•  Famille_Taxonomie.xlsx 

•  sleep_merged.tsv

This data is the folder data



# Project Resources:
Here are additional resources that may be helpful for the project. The dataset has been built from a merge of two studies on sleep duration in mammals:
