# Classification of car model using the Stanford Cars dataset
Computer vision project

# Installation (local)

• Install requirements :

```python
pip install - r requirement.txt 
```

# Project purpose :

• This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict car models across 196 classes using the Stanford Cars Dataset. The objective is to develop a deep learning model that accurately classifies images of cars into their respective make, model, and year categories. This serves as an application of computer vision techniques for fine-grained image classification, leveraging Python and frameworks like TensorFlow. The project is designed to provide insights into building and training CNNs for detailed object recognition tasks.

 # Data used :
 
• The dataset used in this project is the Stanford Cars Dataset, which contains 16,185 images of cars, annotated with the car model name only. The dataset includes 196 different car model classes, representing various makes, models, and production years. The images feature cars from different angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds, offering a realistic variety for training and testing deep learning models. The dataset is specifically curated for fine-grained image classification, allowing models to distinguish subtle visual differences between car models using the provided annotations.











# Project Resources:
Here are additional resources that may be helpful for the project. The dataset has been built from a merge of two studies on sleep duration in mammals:
